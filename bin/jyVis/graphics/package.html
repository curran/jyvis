Provides the graphics API of JyVis. This API is based on the notion 
of adding "visualization primitives" - graphical objects like circles, polygons, lines, text, etc - 
to a "drawing panel" - a panel which renders and provides mouse interactions for a collection of 
visualization primitives. Any visualization primitive can be linked to a data record and set up for
selection interactions. Mouse listeners can be added to any visualization primitive.
